<h1>A Technical documentation for my design of computer in sebastian lague's digital logic simulator.</h1>
<p>Main chips:
<br> CPU: this reads code and sends it to:
<br>INTerpreters which are basically decoders with extra functionality
<br>RAM includes 256 values and a register with the address
<br>Registers A, B, and C, which store 1 value each
<br>ROM stores the program
<br>ALU-3 does adding & subtracting
<br>ALU-0 +1 and -1
<br>NIL always 0
<br>CLU hopefully does conditionalls</p>
<h3>I have a list of commands in a excel file and google sheets</h3>
<h2>credit to sebastian lague, tis 100, the person who made the digital logic sim starter, shenzhen i/o, and my uncle!</h2>
