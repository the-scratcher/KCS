When it says store to, it takes from the bus
When it says read, it reads to the bus
Any result of an alu has the registers used
1 SRA store to register a
2 SRB store to register b
3 SAA store to alu-3 register a
4 SAB store to alu-3 register b
5 RAU read alu sum
6 RRM read current address of ram
7 SAD store to ram address register
8 STR store to current address of ram
9 RRA read register a
10 RRB read register b
11 RDF read alu difference
12 
13 
14 JMP jump to jump address
15 CLEAR CODE runs at start to remove errors
16 BMP adds 1 to alu-0 register and outputs sum
17 BMM subs 1 from alu-0 register and outputs difference
18 SBM stores to alu-0 register
19 CNG flips on conditional switch if bus is negative
20 CPS ditto but positive
21 CZR ditto but equals zero
22 NIL reads nil
23
24 CPU reads 8 bit number to cpu register
25 SCR stores to register c
26 RRC reads from register c
27 CLC resets conditi7cponal toggle
28 RCP reads cpu value
add 32 if conditional
jmp and cpu require a 8 bit number, but first multiply by 256 and add to the command
